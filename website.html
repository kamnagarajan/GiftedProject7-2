	<h1>What are glaciers ? </h1>
	
	<p>Glaciers are a slowly moving mass or river of ice formed 
	by the accumulation and compaction of snow on mountains or 
	near the poles. </p>

	<h2>Formation</h2>

	<div class="normal-paragragh">
	<p >
	 When snow falls, it's later recrystallized and becomes firn.
	 Firn is snow except more compacted with less space bubbles.
	 For a glacier to be formed, the amount of snowfall has to be
	 bigger than the amount now melted away. To be considered a 
	 glacier, it needs to start moving, and for that to happen 
	 its most likely going to be 100 ft. thicker or more. The 
	 minimum size for a glacier is about 25 acres or 100,000 miles ^2. </p>
	</div>
	<h2>Flow</h2>

	<div class="normal-paragragh">
	<p>After a glacier starts moving, there’s the entire thing
	 with how fast it flow and it’s zones. There mainly three 
	 zones that seperate the parts of a glacier that flow the 
	 way they do. The first one is the accumulation zone. This 
	 is the area where the amount of snowfalls is greater than 
	 the amount of snow that melts in the summer. Then there’s 
	 the equilibrium line. This is the part where the amount of 
	 snowfall and the amount of snow melthing away in the summer 
	 are equal. After that, there’s the ablation zone where the 
	 amount of ice thats melted away is greater than the amount 
	 of snowfall.</p>
	</div>
	<h2>Types of Glaciers</h2>

	<div class="normal-paragragh">
	<p>There are mainly two categories of glacier types that exist;
	 Continental and Alpine glaciers. Continental glaciers are
	 dome shaped and cover a lot of area while Alpine glaciers 
	 are usually smaller. Go to <a href="Glaciers.html">Glacial Landforms</a> to learn more.<p>
