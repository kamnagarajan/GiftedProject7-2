	<h1>Glacials landforms</h1>

		 <p>Glacial landforms are mainly classified by how they are 
		 formed. There are two main types, erosional and depositional. 
		 Then, there is also glacial fluvial. Erosional features are 
		 what's left of that part of a glacier after erosion occurs.
		 Depositional features are formed after part of a glacier 
		 has been taken of.</p>

	<h2>Erosional Features</h2> 

		 <p>These types of features are made when a other forces 
		 remove ice from a part of a glacier, or when a glacier 
		 erodes its surroundings. One example of this would be a U-valley.
		 U-valleys are made after a glacier passes through a valley. </p>
	 
		 <p>A glacier can remove mass from its surroundings in multiple 
		 ways. One way is Abrasion. When a glacier loosens the rocks of 
		 its surroundings, and then carries the rocks with it, that is 
		 called plucking. If two glaciers pass by each other on a flat
		 valley, a horn would form in between them. A horn is an example
		 of an erosional glacial feature. </p>
		 
		 <p>Another example of an erosional feature would be a cirque. 
		 A cirque is a depressed bowl shaped valley. For a cirque to form,
		 a glacier would form in a lake, then after a bowl shaped 
		 depression forms and the glacier melts, what it’s left behind 
		 would be a cirque. The glacier itself can form a cirque on a 
		 flat valley from the abrasion occurring on the bottom between 
		 the ground and itself. </p>
		
	<h2>Depositional features</h2>

		 <p>Depositional features are what’s left over from the glacier 
		 after it retreats. One of the biggest depositional features are 
		 moraines. Moraines are left over rock from the rock the glacier 
		 picked up. They are classified by their location on the glacier.</p>
		 
		 <p>Erratics are also a type of depositional feature. When a 
		 glacier picks up rocks, it also carries them till a glacier 
		 melts. There are times when a a glacier picks up a huge rock 
		 then carries it thousands of miles away from its original habitat,
		 in that case it would be called an erratic. The rock is usually way 
		 diffferent from its surroundings. </p>
         <p>Drumlins are another type of despositional feature. After a 
		 glacier passes over some land, there’s a lot of feature it leaves
		 behind, one of them being drumlins. A drum line is an elongated 
		 sloped hill. One side of the glacier is steep while the other has 
		 a gentle slope. From this, we can usually tell which direction the 
		 glacier flowed.</p>


		 <p>Glaciers are usually categorized by how they are formed, so 
		 once you know a glaciers categorization, you would be able to tell 
		 how it’s been formed. </p>
