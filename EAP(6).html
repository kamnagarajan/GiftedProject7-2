<h2>Brain Lesion</h2>

<p>Most likely would start off having slight sicknesses like headaches and nausea. In the few days before death, would become more and more confused and have greater and greater personality changes and memory loss. Would pass away without fuss, like falling asleep.

<p>One of the strongest aspects of this theory would be how well it explains his state of mind when he was picked up. People suffering from brain lesions would have confusion, memory loss, and delirium. Poe showed all of these symptoms when he was picked up. 
</p>

<p> The coma he went into after getting picked up were also one of the effects of a brain lesion.

<p> 
The symptoms of brain lesions are very loose, it is hard to diagnose and is especially difficult when you can’t run tests.
