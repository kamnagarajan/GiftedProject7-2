     <h1>Glacial effects </h1>
     <p>Glaciers have had a lot of effects on earth in the past. 
	 One of the more obvious examples would be changes in sea 
	 level. During the last age, sea level was 400 meters below 
	 now. </p>
	 
	 <h3>Isostatic Rebound</h3>
	 <p>Isostatic rebound is another effect glaciers have on 
	 earth. When huge glaciers form, they push down the crust 
	 beneath them. That causes the crust around them to start 
	 rising up then go back sown again. Of course this takes 
	 place on a very large time scale, and there are some 
	 examples of this right now. The area around Greenland 
	 is still rising due to the weight of Ice Sheet. If this 
	 is hard to understand, one thing you could compare it to 
	 is when you push down on a soft surface such as a pillow. 
	 When you push down on one spot the area surround it comes 
	 up, and when you lift your finger away the area goes back 
	 to how it was before. This is basically what isostatic 
	 rebound is, but over a very long time scale.</p>
	 
	 <h3>Runaway Albedo Effect</h3>
     <p>The runaway albedo effect is also something that would
	 have a great impact on us. Albedo is the amount of light
	 a surface reflects back. To start with, ice has an albedo 
	 of 55-80% while ocean water typically has an albedo of 
	 12-15%. If a surface has an albedo of 100%, then it reflects
	 all of the light, but if it has an albedo of 0%, then it 
	 reflects nothing back. This means that glaciers are better
	 than ocean water at helping reduce the temperature rise. 
	 Since earth is already warming, this means that we’re losing
	 the amount of reflection we have, which leads to earth 
	 getting warmer and losing more glaciers. You can see where
	 they get “runaway” part from, glaciers stat melting faster
	 and faster. This also works the other way, if the earth 
	 starts cooling, ice sheets reflect even more heat into 
	 space which leads to more ice sheets forming. </p>
