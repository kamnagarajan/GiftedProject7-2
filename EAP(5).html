<h2>Rabies</h2>
<p>He must have had rabies. He had hallucinations, partial paralysis, and was in a state of delirium. </p>

<div class="container" ><img src="Rabies(yes).PNG"></div>

<div ><p>
After getting bitten by some sort of animal, they wouldn’t remember getting bitten by an animal. After getting infected, the virus infects the nerves. The virus keeps spreading for around 2-8 weeks. After rabies has infected the brain, the victim is probably going to die from it.
</p>
</div>


<h3>Time Frame</h3>
<p>The time frame to get and show symptoms of rabies is aroun 2-8 weeks. The time he disappeared (1-2 weeks) is too short for him to die from it in the hospital.
</p>

<h3>Symptoms</h3> 
<p>He had hydrophobia, rabies people can’t swallow water. One of the symptoms were extreme worry, that should explain him calling that name out loud repeatedly. Hallucinations are one of the side effects of rabies, all the reports say Poe was hallucinating.</p>

We, like everyone, are not entirely sure how he died, so we just compiled the evidence and let you figure out for yourself what you think it was. 
Thanks for playing!.<br>
