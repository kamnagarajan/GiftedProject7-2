<h2> Dr. J. E. Snodgrass's account</h2>
<img src = "BrownHairDude.jpg" width = "200" height "300"> 
<!---Dr. J. E. Snodgrass---> 
<p>Snodgrass's first-hand account describes 
Poe's appearance as "repulsive", with unkempt 
hair, a haggard, unwashed face and "lusterless 
and vacant" eyes. His clothing, Snodgrass said, 
which included a dirty shirt but no vest and 
unpolished shoes, was worn and did not fit well. 
He also said he was “in a state of beastly intoxication” 
and was in a semi-conscious state and acting 
deliriously.<p>
