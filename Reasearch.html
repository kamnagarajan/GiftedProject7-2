<h1>Glacier Research</h1>

     <h3>Ice Cores</h3>
     <p>Ice cores help us discover things about our past. 
	 Ice Cores are basically samples of glaciers. They cut 
	 out a cylinder downwards into the ice. There are many 
	 things you can get from an ice core sample.  When ice 
	 forms, it contains little bubbles of air from the time 
	 it formed. So for ice buried deep into a glacier, their 
	 air bubbles can tell you about the climate back then. 
	 There are also layers in the ice core from which you can
	 tell the history of advance and retreat, the darker layers
	 are from sediment buildup on the surface from when the 
	 ice was exposed. </p>

     <h3>Ice Ages</h3>
     <p>There have been many ice ages in the past. The 5 
	 main glacial ice ages, listed in order from oldest to 
	 youngest ; Huronian, cryogenical, Anedean-Saharan, Karoo,
	 Quaternary. During the last ice age, one ice sheet called 
	 the Laurentide ice sheet, covered most of North America. 
	 The glacier extended as far as Louisiana. Scientists call 
	 ice ages Glacial Maximums. There have also been no ice caps 
	 for the last billion years, leading the sea level to be 70 
	 meters higher. The main causes of ice ages have been labeled 
	 the Milankovitch Cycle. That is about how earth’s orbit, tilt,
	 and wobbles on its axis are the main cause of the warming and 
	 cooling on earth. And from the milankovitch cycle, every 100,000
	 years the conditions are just enough to make sure the summer can’t
	 melt away the previous winter’s ice. <p>
