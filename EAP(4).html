<h3>Hallucinations</h3>
<p>One of the common symptoms of alcoholism is hallucinations. During his stay in the hospital, people also said that he had multiple hallucinations

<!--add bad thing--> 

<p> To start, alchol wasn't in his hair. When someone dies, we can check their hair for any traces of alchol. When we checked Poe's hair, we didn't find any alchol. This completly gets rid of this theory.
