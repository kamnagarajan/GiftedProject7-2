<!---Alcholism---> 
<h2>Alcholism</h2>

<p> He must be intoxicated. He was imagining things, had symptoms of mental confusion, and was almost in a coma. He even was found near a tavern. 
</p>

<img src = "Alcholism(yes).JPG" >
<h3>Hallucinations</h3>
<p>One of the common symptoms of alcoholism is hallucinations. During his stay in the hospital, people also said that he had multiple hallucinations 
</p>

<p>This theory would explain his bad state when he was found.  People who have alcoholism usually don't or forget to take care of themselves. This is another strong point of alcoholism.
</p>

<!--add bad thing--> 

<p> To start, alchol wasn't in his hair. When someone dies, we can check their hair for any traces of alchol. When we checked Poe's hair, we didn't find any alchol. This completly gets rid of this theory.

We, like everyone, are not entirely sure how he died, so we just compiled the evidence and let you figure out for yourself what you think it was. 
Thanks for playing!.<br>
