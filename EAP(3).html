<h2> Dr. J. J. Moran's account</h2>
<img src = "BrownHaireDude.JPG" width = "200" height "300">
<p> Dr. John Joseph Moran, who was Poe's attending 
physician, gives a detailed account of Poe's appearance 
that day: “a stained faded, old bombazine coat, 
pantaloons of a similar character, a pair of worn-out 
shoes run down at the heels, and an old straw hat.” 
He also described his physical condition, “he had not 
the slightest odor of liquor upon his breath or person” 
and that during a period of consciousness, Poe held 
"vacant converse with spectral and imaginary objects 
on the walls. His face was pale and his whole person 
drenched in perspiration." </p>
